title: Fix an issue with ArchLan packages repository signing

ArchLan Linux has it's own package repository added to the pacman configuration.
If, at some point, you encounter this error while trying to update;

```bash
error: archlan-packages: signature from "Lanhild (ArchLan Linux PGP key, made by @Lanhild.) <archlan@protonmail.com>" is unknown trust
error: failed to synchronize all databases (invalid or corrupted database (PGP signature))
```
Follow the steps in this post to fix it.

<!--truncate-->

1. The first step is to import the ArchLan Linux gpg key from the keyserver to your machine:

```bash
$ sudo pacman-key --recv-keys 5F765E0E531F5B53
```
2. By precaution, verify the fingerprint of the key:

```bash
$ sudo pacman-key --finger 5F765E0E531F5B53
```
3. The last step is to locally sign the key:

```bash
$ sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 5F765E0E531F5B53
```

:::note
Once all these steps have been accomplished, you should be able to successfully update and install packages from the ArchLan repository.
