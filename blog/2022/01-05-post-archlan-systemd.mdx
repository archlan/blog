During the ArchLan ISO building, the file `run_before_squashfs.sh` executes operations in the last steps of the ISO building process.
Some of these operations might not succesfully work. If you encounter issues, follow the steps in this post to solve them.

```bash
$ nmcli
Error: NetworkManager is not running.
```
Follow the steps in this post to fix it.

<!--truncate-->

1. In order to get the NetworkManager service unit to work
```bash
$ sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
```
You should now be able to use network connection on your machine.
