When booting in the ArchLan live environment, it is possible that the lightdm display manager didn't start automatically. If it's your case, just run this command:
```bash
# The password for the liveuser is "archlan"
$ sudo systemctl start lightdm.service
```

>This issue will be fixed in the next releases.
