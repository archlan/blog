export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '4px',
      color: '#b924ff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

A newer interface is now shipped by default with ArchLan.

Themes have been added with the option to choose between theme, using a simple
shortcut. `$kyoto+v` (where `$kyoto` refers to "Ctrl") toggles the new ArchLan ThemeSwitch
interface that allows you to choose between a multitude of varied and colorful themes.
