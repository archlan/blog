## Verify the authenticity of the ISO
- Download the <Highlight>`ISO`</Highlight>, <Highlight>`GPG signature`</Highlight> and the <Highlight>`sha256sum`</Highlight> files
- Ensure that all the files you have downloaded are present in the same directory as the ISO
- Verify the key on the keyserver:
```bash
$ gpg --recv-keys 5F765E0E531F5B53
```

- Verify the iso signature:
```bash
$ gpg --verify archlan-2022.01.16-x86_64.iso.sig
```

- Then verify the `sha256sum`:
```bash
$ sha256sum -c archlan-2022.01.16-x86_64.iso.sha256sum
```
